Bubble Sort 
-> algorithm -> pushes the max element to the last by adjacent swapping
-> Worst case and average  case TIME COMPLEXITY -> O(N^2)
-> Best case TIME COMPLEXITY -> O(N)
Selection Sort
-> algorithm -> select the minimum and swap
-> Best case TIME COMPLEXITY -> O(N)
Insertion Sort
-> algorithm -> take a element and place it in correct order
-> worst case and average case TIME COMPLEXITY -> O(N^2)
-> Best case TIME COMPLEXITY -> O(N)
