Bubble Sort 
-> algorithm -> pushes the max element to the last by adjacent swapping
-> Worst case and average  case TIME COMPLEXITY -> O(N^2)
-> Best case TIME COMPLEXITY -> O(N)
Selection Sort
-> algorithm -> select the minimum and swap
-> Best case TIME COMPLEXITY -> O(N)
Insertion Sort
-> algorithm -> take a element and place it in correct order
-> worst case and average case TIME COMPLEXITY -> O(N^2)
-> Best case TIME COMPLEXITY -> O(N)
Merge Sort
-> algorithm -> Divide and Merge Algorithm

selection sort algo
-> find min and swap
-> for outer loop -> start from 0th index to (n-2) index , because we dont want to swap the last index
-> for inner loop -> start from ith index to (n-1) index and find the minimum element
-> check if arr[j] is smaller than arr[min] if true swap both numbers positions
